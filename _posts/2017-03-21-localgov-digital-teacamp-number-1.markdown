Last Thursday I attended a teacamp organised by LocalGov Digital's London Peer Group at The Draft House Tower Bridge.

LocalGov Digital is a network (which I help run!) for people who want to make better public services. You can find out more on their website.

This teacamp is the first in a series of informal meetups involving both tea and cake whilst looking at different points from the Local Government Digital Service Standard (LGDSS). The standard is a set of 15 points covering a common approach for local authorities to deliver good quality, user centered, value for money digital services. It's based on the Digital Service Standard that was first published by the Government Digital Service in 2013 and is something that all public facing transactional central government services must adhere to - services like register to vote or tax your vehicle. It's an approach I would like to see us start to use at both Kingston and Sutton.

This first teacamp was about agile and more specifically point 3 from the LGDSS.

3. Create a service using the agile, iterative and user-centred methods set out in the Government Service Design Manual.

The session began with everyone just getting to know each other or catching up with colleagues. There was then a short talk by Martin Evans from Unboxed who talked about the principles of agile and Lean Startup before moving on to the work they've been doing with the new digital team at Newham.

The meetup was then opened up to everyone to ask questions or share stories via a fishbowl discussion.

## Fishbowl discussion

The fishbowl consists of 4 chairs with only 3 allowed to be filled at anyone time. The only people who are allowed to join in with the conversation are the three on the chairs. If someone wants to join the conversation they need to sit on the vacant fourth chair and one of the other 3 must rejoin the audience. It perhaps sounds complicated but it wasn't at all and the conversation flowed well. I've found the question and answer sessions where there is a panel and then discussion with an audience can be challenging to follow and can end up being disjointed - the fishbowl worked much better. Chatham House rules were also applied so people could speak freely.

It was a really great session and a good opportunity to meet people from other council digital teams from London. The next teacamp is scheduled to be held towards the end of April, keep an eye on the LocalGov Digital Eventbrite page for updates.
